# 🫀 Voxel-Based Analysis and Clustering of Cardiac Regions in Lung Cancer Patients

This project explores the relationship between cardiac radiation dose and 2-year overall survival (OS) in stage 3 LA-NSCLC patients. Using **voxel-wise statistical modeling**, **unsupervised clustering**, and **advanced visualization**, we investigate spatial dose patterns in CT scans to identify regions most associated with survival outcomes.

## 🧠 Methodology Overview

<img src="visuals/pipeline.gif" width="100%" alt="Pipeline Overview"/>

This project follows a multi-stage analytical pipeline:
1. **Preprocessing** of DICOM/CT data
2. **Voxel-Based Analysis (VBA)** for statistical modeling
3. **Unsupervised Clustering** to identify spatial dose patterns
4. **Statistical Significance Testing** (e.g., Welch’s t-test, FDR correction)
5. **Visualization** of results for interpretation

## 🧠 Analysis Workflow

This diagram illustrates the full pipeline:
- **Input**: Patient CT scans and dose maps
- **Deformation Step**: All patient data is mapped to a common anatomical template
- **Statistical Analysis**: Voxel-wise comparisons between survivor groups
- **Output**: p-value maps indicating regions associated with 2-year survival

## 📊 Key Visualizations

| Concept | Visualization |
|--------|----------------|
| **Raw Data** | <img src="output.gif" width="500"/> <br> |
| **Dose Distribution Comparison** | <img src="clideo_editor_4eb173ba0818435a8c0e81e1763eefac.gif" width="500"/> <br> A quick animation showing different dose maps among patients. <br> It visually demonstrates the spread and variation of radiation across individuals. |
| **Voxel-Wise Group Dose Characteristics** | <img src="charts.jpg" width="600"/> <br> Boxplots and histograms compare survivors (YES) and non-survivors (NO) for: <br> ▫️ % of zero-dose voxels <br> ▫️ Mean dose of non-zero voxels <br> 👉 Survivors tend to have more voxels spared and more focused dosing. |
| **Axial Dose Distribution Map** | <img src="heat.jpg" width="600"/> <br> Heatmaps of mean dose across an axial slice: <br> ▫️ Left: Right side of heart <br> ▫️ Right: Left side of heart <br> Indicates spatial asymmetry in dose distribution. |
| **Cropping by ROI** | <img src="final.jpg" width="600"/> <br> Manual cropping of 3D dose maps using a fixed coordinate window, applied consistently across patients. <br> This prepares the data for spatial analysis using the following radiobiological normalization: <br> <img src="eqd2formula.jpg" width="250"/> <br> ☢️ The **EQD₂ formula** adjusts physical dose (D) using a **biological weighting factor**, based on the linear-quadratic model with tissue-specific **α/β** ratios. <br> ▫️ Two settings were applied: α/β = 2 (for late-responding tissues) and α/β = 5 (intermediate case). |
| **Spatial Clustering Result** | <img src="3d.jpg" width="450"/> <br> **3D voxel cluster plot** showing statistically significant regions (colored labels). <br> ▫️ Clustering was applied after thresholding voxel-wise p-values <br> ▫️ Labels **39, 42, 46, 47** show spatial coherence across the heart region, pointing to potential anatomical biomarkers. |
| **Dose Distribution & Outlier Detection Summary** | <img src="imgonline-com-ua-2to1-iJFJSxPrRf8Ad.jpg" width="700"/> <br> **Histograms of Maximum and Mean Dose per Patient**: Survivors: mean dose ≈ **1.83**, higher % of zero-dose voxels (**10.46%**) ; Non-survivors: mean dose ≈ **1.88**, lower % of zero-dose voxels (**5.59%**) Indicates survivors may receive more focused dosing. |

---

## 💡 Findings

- Survivors had more **focused** and **precise** dose distributions in heart regions
- Non-survivors showed **broader, less localized** exposure
- No single heart substructure showed consistent significant association across all patients
- Template alignment was crucial for meaningful voxel-wise comparisons
